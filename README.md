# Daily Tarot 

This is a NextJS tarot chat app bootstrapped with [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). It uses [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for accounts, [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) for protected procedures, and Vercel's [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction) to route to different LLMs selected by the user. It is deployed via Vercel [here](https://t3-chat-app-ho6w.vercel.app/).

Chats with AI support tool calling, generative UI, response streaming, and more. It is aimed to help users reflect and better understand their tarot readings. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```
