# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI/UX issues in the chat application interface, specifically focusing on layout sizing problems and missing auto-scroll functionality. The chat window currently has width constraints that prevent it from utilizing the full available space, and lacks automatic scrolling to show the latest messages as they stream in. Additionally, there are theme inconsistencies that need to be resolved to provide a cohesive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user engaging in a chat conversation, I want the chat window to utilize the full width of its container, so that I can see more content and have a better reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat page loads THEN the chat container SHALL expand to fill the full width of its parent container
2. WHEN the viewport is resized THEN the chat container SHALL maintain full width responsiveness
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the chat layout SHALL remain properly proportioned

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user receiving streaming chat messages, I want the chat window to automatically scroll to the bottom, so that I can always see the latest messages without manual scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new message is received THEN the chat window SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
2. WHEN messages are streaming in real-time THEN the scroll position SHALL continuously update to follow the stream
3. WHEN a user manually scrolls up to read previous messages THEN auto-scroll SHALL be temporarily disabled
4. WHEN a user scrolls back to the bottom manually THEN auto-scroll SHALL re-enable automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want consistent theming throughout the chat interface, so that the visual experience is cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the chat interface THEN all components SHALL follow the established theme colors and styles
2. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN all chat components SHALL update consistently
3. WHEN comparing chat elements to other UI components THEN the styling SHALL be harmonious and consistent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the chat interface to be responsive and functional, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the chat on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL be optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN using the chat on desktop THEN the interface SHALL take advantage of available screen real estate
3. WHEN transitioning between device orientations THEN the chat layout SHALL adapt smoothly
