# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create landing page component
  - Build a welcoming landing page component that displays app information and authentication options for unauthenticated users
  - Include hero section, features showcase, and prominent sign in/sign up buttons
  - Use existing design system components and maintain consistent styling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 2. Implement route protection middleware
  - Create Next.js middleware to protect chat routes from unauthenticated access
  - Configure middleware to check authentication status for /chat and /chat/* routes
  - Implement redirect logic to send unauthenticated users to landing page
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Update root page routing logic
  - Modify the root page to show landing page for unauthenticated users instead of redirecting to signin
  - Keep redirect to /chat for authenticated users
  - Remove automatic redirect to signin page
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 4. Enhance authentication flow redirects
  - Update signin and signup forms to redirect authenticated users to /chat
  - Modify signin/signup pages to redirect authenticated users away from auth pages
  - Ensure successful authentication always leads to /chat
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Implement proper sign out redirect
  - Update AuthStatus component to redirect to landing page immediately after sign out
  - Ensure sign out clears authentication state and redirects to root URL
  - Remove any existing logout component in favor of enhanced AuthStatus
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Add authentication state transition handling
  - Implement smooth navigation between authentication states with proper loading states
  - Add session expiration handling that gracefully redirects to landing page
  - Ensure authentication state changes update UI within 500ms
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive tests for authentication flows
  - Write unit tests for landing page component rendering in different auth states
  - Create tests for middleware route protection logic
  - Add integration tests for complete authentication flows (sign in → chat → sign out → landing)
  - Test session expiration and redirect handling
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
