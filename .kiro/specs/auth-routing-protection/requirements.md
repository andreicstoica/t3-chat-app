# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive route protection and authentication flow improvements for the tarot chat application. The goal is to ensure users are properly redirected based on their authentication status, create a proper landing page for unauthenticated users, and secure all protected routes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, I want to be redirected to a welcoming landing page when I visit the application, so that I understand what the app offers and can easily sign in or sign up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits the root URL ("/") THEN the system SHALL display a landing page with app description and authentication options
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits any protected route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the landing page
3. IF a user is on the landing page THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation to sign in and sign up pages
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access "/chat" or "/chat/[id]" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the landing page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to be automatically redirected to the chat interface when I visit the landing page, so that I can immediately access the main functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user visits the root URL ("/") THEN the system SHALL redirect them to "/chat"
2. WHEN an authenticated user visits "/signin" or "/signup" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to "/chat"
3. IF a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to "/chat"
4. IF a user successfully signs up THEN the system SHALL redirect them to "/chat"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who signs out, I want to be immediately redirected to the landing page, so that I know I've been logged out and can easily sign back in if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the sign out button THEN the system SHALL immediately redirect them to the landing page
2. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication state
3. IF a user signs out from any page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the root URL ("/")
4. WHEN a user is redirected after sign out THEN the system SHALL display the landing page with sign in options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all chat-related routes to be protected by authentication middleware, so that unauthorized users cannot access chat functionality or data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access "/chat" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the landing page
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access "/chat/[id]" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the landing page
3. IF authentication middleware detects an invalid or expired session THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the landing page
4. WHEN a protected route is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify authentication before rendering the page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the landing page to be informative and welcoming, so that I understand the purpose of the tarot chat application and feel encouraged to create an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL display the application name and description
2. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL show key features of the tarot chat functionality
3. IF a user is on the landing page THEN the system SHALL provide prominent sign in and sign up buttons
4. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL use consistent branding and styling with the rest of the application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation between authentication states, so that the application feels responsive and I'm never stuck on an inappropriate page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI within 500ms
2. WHEN a redirect occurs due to authentication THEN the system SHALL not show loading states longer than necessary
3. IF a user's session expires while using the app THEN the system SHALL gracefully redirect them to the landing page
4. WHEN navigation occurs due to authentication changes THEN the system SHALL preserve any appropriate state or show relevant messages
